# BiconnectCode
Reasoning behind your technical choices 
Used the basic Socket .net class to implement both server and client.
Used static all over to maintain a single TCP server to handle multiple client
Dispose has been called to ensure proper dispose.
Used ManualResetEvent to indicate the state of the socket and received.



Trade-offs you might have made or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
Wanted to write a general component that can connect to TCP, HTTP and so on.Write a Factory pattern to create serverâ€™s.
Dependency Injection for passing in the parameter of the TCP/HTTP property.
Use base interface to allow extensibility.
Maintain a hash table with session id of with unquie id for  client connected to enable better reporting for count and counter.
Remove the static and add lauch the TCP server on a thread(task)
